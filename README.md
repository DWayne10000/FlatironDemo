<h1>Profile</h1>
  
  Greetings. My name is Jacoby.
<br>
  I am a student at an online coding school.
<p>
  I just started taking this course recently. I learned the basics of HTML and JavaScript before,
  <br>
  but I still have difficulty building websites, especially a Five Nights at Freddy's fan mande
  <br>
  website that I want to make. Hopefully, by the end of this course, I will be able to do so.
